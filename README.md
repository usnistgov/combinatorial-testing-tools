# Combinatorial Testing Tools #
Tools for combinatorial testing developed by the NIST ACTS project

## CCMCL - Combinatorial Coverage Measurement Command Line Tool##
A real time combinatorial coverage measurement tool. Based off of [CCM](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts/download_tools.html#measure), but with enhanced functionality. 

### Supported Operating Systems: ###

- Windows
- Mac OS
- Linux

### Key Features:###

- Measure the combinatorial coverage of static test case files
- Generate missing combinations from given test cases
- Generate random tests
- Measure combinatorial coverage in real time via various input modes
  - Standard Input
  - Output of external programs
  - TCP/IP 
- Specify robust constraints
- Support for equivalence classes and groups via SET notation definitions
- Read ACTS configuration files via `.txt` or `.xml`
